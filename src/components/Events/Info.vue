    <p>Hi. If you are here that means you wanna know something.</p>
    <strong>--- Endless progress?</strong>
    <p>
    Endgame content is 300 Level(Abyss T3)
    </p>
    <strong>--- Why LevelUp?</strong>
    <p>
    I think this title will make sense when you reach 700 level or when you break the reality and open the first dimension. (It's all about future content)
    </p>
    <strong>AFK</strong>
    <p>
    When you are AFK enemies are getting stronger. You can kill only 1 enemy per second. Total enemy kills based on max stage passed * 50. You can pass stages until the boss. You can avoid it
    when the stage boss is lower than max stage minus 15. Exp gain based on current stage and active perks from Tree, Ascension, Rebirth. Buffs and Formations don't work. <strong>AFK doesn't work in Abyss</strong>
